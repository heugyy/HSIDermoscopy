# HSIDermoscopy
This repo is to provide datasets that are described in: A Hyperspectral Dermoscopy Dataset for Melanoma Detection. The codes that are used for Raspberry PI based imaging device is provided in [RPI-GUI-for-Ximea-Camera](https://github.com/heugyy/RPI-GUI-for-Ximea-Camera). More details of the hardware part are described in Chapter 5 in [Melanoma Detection Based on Color and Hyperspectral Imaging](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/handle/10072/386570/Gu,%20Yanyang%20Final%20Thesis_Redacted.pdf?sequence=1)
